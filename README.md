<h3 align="center">Whitelisted ERC20 TokenSale Contracts (@whitelisted-tokensale)</h3><div align="center"></div>

[@whitelisted-tokensale](https://github.com/galtproject/whitelisted-tokensale) is a set of Ethereum smart contracts for the sale of ERC20 tokens for others ERC20 tokens with specific rates. 

Smart contracts have Administrators and Managers roles. These roles are designed to:
- manage the whitelist of customers;
- add and remove ERC20 tokens for which sale is carried out;
- define exchange rates;
- set a wallet where tokens received from the sale will be sent;
- pause tokens sale if necessary.
